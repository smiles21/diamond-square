# Diamond Square Algorithm

The diamond-square algorithm is a method for generating heightmaps
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm)).

This is an iterative implementation of the diamond-square algorithm
which allows for customizable size and noisiness.  

`main.py` is just the main function to generate and print the output.
`plotter.py` plots the surface in `matplotlib`.
